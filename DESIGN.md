# Point-of-Sale (POS) Ultrasonic Key Exchange and Satellite Relay Protocol

## Context

This document outlines a secure transaction protocol that combines ultrasonic key exchange and satellite relay for data transmission. The protocol is designed to facilitate secure financial transactions, particularly in scenarios where traditional internet infrastructure may be compromised or unavailable, such as during natural disasters.

## Use Case

The primary use cases are:

1. To enable secure cryptocurrency donations for disaster relief efforts, allowing individuals worldwide to contribute funds efficiently and securely.

2. To assist local businesses in disaster-affected areas to continue operations by providing a resilient payment system, even when traditional infrastructure is damaged.

3. To empower affected individuals to use the donated funds for necessities through a network of participating local businesses using the POS app.

This comprehensive approach ensures that donations can be received, businesses can operate, and individuals can access essential goods and services, all within a secure and functional economic ecosystem during and after a disaster.

## Protocol Flow

1. **Transaction Initiation**:
   - Customer selects items and indicates readiness to pay on the POS terminal.
   - POS terminal sends transaction details to the POS server.

2. **Server Preparation**:
   - POS server generates a unique transaction ID.
   - Server prepares a notification for the customer's device.

3. **Customer Device Notification**:
   - Server sends a push notification to the customer's mobile app.
   - Notification prompts the customer to enable audio settings for payment.
   - Customer confirms and enables audio reception on their device.

4. **Device Readiness Confirmation**:
   - Customer's app sends confirmation of audio readiness to the server.
   - Server relays this confirmation to the POS terminal.

5. **Key Generation**:
   - POS terminal generates a unique encryption key for the transaction.

6. **Ultrasonic Key Exchange**:
   - POS terminal encodes the encryption key and transaction ID into an ultrasonic signal.
   - POS terminal transmits the ultrasonic signal.
   - Customer's device, now listening, receives and decodes the ultrasonic signal.

7. **Transaction Verification**:
   - Customer's device sends the received transaction ID back to the server for verification.
   - Server confirms the transaction ID matches the ongoing transaction.

8. **Payment Data Preparation**:
   - Customer's device encrypts payment information using the received key.

9. **Satellite Relay Transmission**:
   - Encrypted payment data is sent via satellite relay to the POS server.

10. **Transaction Processing**:
    - POS server processes the transaction.

11. **Confirmation**:
    - Server sends confirmation to both the POS terminal and the customer's device.
    - Customer's app disables the audio reception mode.

## Security Analysis: Unintended Device Reception

In the event that another device in the vicinity also listens to the ultrasonic signal:

1. **Signal Reception**:
   - The unintended device may receive the ultrasonic signal containing the encryption key and transaction ID.

2. **Decoding Attempt**:
   - The unintended device might successfully decode the ultrasonic signal.

3. **Transaction ID Mismatch**:
   - When the unintended device attempts to send the transaction ID back to the server for verification, it will not match any ongoing transaction for that device.

4. **Server Rejection**:
   - The server will reject the verification attempt from the unintended device due to the transaction ID mismatch.

5. **Transaction Failure for Unintended Device**:
   - The unintended device will not be able to proceed with any transaction using the received key.

6. **Security Maintenance**:
   - The original transaction remains secure, as the server only processes the transaction for the device with the matching transaction ID.

This security measure ensures that even if multiple devices receive the ultrasonic signal, only the intended device with the correct transaction ID can complete the transaction. This adds an additional layer of security to the ultrasonic key exchange process.

## Advantages of the Protocol

1. **Resilience**: Operates during infrastructure disruptions due to satellite relay usage.
2. **Security**: Combines ultrasonic key exchange and satellite relay for enhanced security.
3. **Targeted Communication**: Ensures only the intended device can complete the transaction.
4. **User Control**: Gives customers control over when their device listens for payment information.
5. **Minimal Interference**: Reduces disturbance to nearby devices not involved in the transaction.

## Considerations for Implementation

- Ensure app functionality for background notifications and audio processing.
- Optimize the process for quick response times to maintain efficiency.
- Educate users on the need for temporary audio access during transactions.
- Implement fallback methods (e.g., NFC, QR codes) for scenarios where ultrasonic transmission fails.
